Sentiment analysis is the prediction of sentiment  of a given text.

Traditionally, a binary sentiment analysis for the IMDb dataset is very popular, where only highly polarizing reviews 
are considered (a negative review has a score ≤ 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score ≥ 7 out of 10). 

Here, the aim for the project is to build up an application which will predict the sentiment of an input text with a score from 1 to 10. 
Input data is 15,000 IMDb reviews. I tested several models. Please find about all steps and models in the presentation.  

The trained model is used for the application to make a prediction. This app might be used for sentiment analysis of 
any English text, but the most accurate prediction will be provided for movie, performance or game reviews.
The application is __tprojects.pythonanywhere.com__ (30-40 s loading time).
